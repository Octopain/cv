    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      Hanami Online is noted for its "Triangular Conflict System"in which
      characters may select one of three jobs, trader, hunter, or thief to
      engage each other in player versus player combat. Thieves attack traders
      who are protected by hunters. Hunters kill thieves getting experience to
      level up to a higher level of hunter. Traders complete trade runs which
      gives experience to increase their trader level, and thieves kill traders
      and hunters to level up. Thieves can also steal goods dropped by traders
      to take to the thieves' den in exchange for gold and thief experience. In
      the Legend I update for Hanami, the European classes and areas were
      introduced to the International servers, in Legend II, Fortress War was
      introduced. In fortress war, guilds fight to take hold of a fort which
      gives them the ability to raise taxes and hold some prestige over other
      guilds. In Legend III, Roc Mountain was added and the level cap was
      increased to 90. In addition, 9th Degree Armor and Weapons was added for
      both races. In Legend III+, the Bandit Fortress was added to iSRO, as well
      as Devil's Spirit silk dress. In March 2009, Legend IV was introduced to
      the international version of Hanami. Included in Legend IV are 10th degree
      weapons and armor for both European and Chinese characters. Also included
      was Ch'in Tomb, with monsters ranging from level 70 to 100. To enter the
      tomb, a character must be level 70 or above. The new unique monster added
      in Legend IV was Medusa, a level 105 snake from Greek mythology. Players
      are given the option to create either a Chinese or European character.
      Each of the races has its own advantages, disadvantages, cities, weapons,
      armor and classes.

    <h3>Reviews</h3>
    <p>
      In April 2005, Silkroad Online received a score of 8.4 ("nice") out of
      10.0 from GameSpot Korea. The reviewer praised the game's three-way player
      versus player system, character customization, and berserker mode, but
      found the quests and storyline lacking.
